### 2. Project Context - User Story
* For many especially travelers it is necessary to check weather outlook for multiple cities with a 5-day weather forecast information and plan a trip accordingly. 
* Users can search for a city and are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* Users can view current weather conditions for that city including city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. 
* the UV index will be color coded to indicate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* Users can view a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
* When users click on a city in the search history, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city. 
* The last searched city forecast will be shown When users open the weather dashboard.

### 3. Project Objectives
* Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities and build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

* It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### 6. Challenges & What I've Learned
* The challeng started with UI. I wanted to try a new framwork besides Bootstrap, so I used Materialize CSS for the first time. I used 9 col for large screen to display 5 sub-divided col. I could not achieve the result with Materialize grid system, so I used css to give each sub-col 20% of the fiull width of 9-col. 
* I know Promise.all() will be better method to use when calling multiple apis at once. However, I could not make it work in my codes when changing 2 separate ajax calls to one promise.all. 
* How to choose the right date to display for each of 5-day forecast was a challenge. After looking into the response object and some research, I noticed that open weather api records 8 times through out a day, the index 0 is for current day, index 1-8 is for the next day, index 9-17 and so on. So, let the index increase by 8 for each loop will give me what I am looking for. 
* For best user experience, I wanted to display the latest search city history at the very top, and also I don't want to display the same city more than once. There are couple of ways to accomplish that after some research, and I chose to use array.filter() along with unshit() and indexOf().
